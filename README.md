I had initially forked from the above, but at some point I fought a losing battle with git and then, I ended up downloading the repo as a zip and then realized that this loses all git information. I was too tired to fork.clone etc, so just added the contents of the zip to my repo. 
I will fork again, and give due credit ASAP.
